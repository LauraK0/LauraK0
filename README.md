### About Me

---

- Software Developer with a background in architecture and design
- I studied at the Glasgow School of Art where I focused on contextual and sustainable architecture. 
- Early on in my career I discovered coding through using a visual programming language to automate the production of construction information.
- From then on, the more I've learned about programming, the more I enjoyed it.
- I am also interested in art and design and enjoy visiting exhibitions and exploring different parts of London in my spare time.
