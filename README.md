### About Me

---

- Software Developer with a background in architecture and design
- I studied at the Glasgow School of Art where I focused on contextural and sustainable architecture. 
- After graduating, I developed a keen interest in coding through creating scripts using a visual programming language to automate the production of construction information.
- Since then, I have found that using logic and code to solve challenges deeply rewarding. 
- I am also interested in art and design and keen to get out to exhibitions/ visit different parts of London in my spare time.
